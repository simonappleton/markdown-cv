## Profile

With 12+ years of data analysis experience I have added a solid understanding of statistical methods and variety of advanced analytical tools over the last 5 years. 
I have a broad range of experience and I'm looking for a new challenge to combine my passions for sustainability and data science in an environment where I get to model the real world.
My work has previously been used in scientific research, governmental press releases and formed the basis for significant commercial decisions.

## Profile

With 12+ years of data analysis experience I have added a solid understanding of statistical methods and variety of advanced analytical tools over the last 5 years. 
I have a broad range of experience and I'm looking for a new challenge to combine my passions for sustainability and data science in an environment where I get to model the real world.
My work has previously been used in scientific research, governmental press releases and formed the basis for significant commercial decisions. 

## Experience

### Arcadis Gen - Data and Decision Science
**Senior Data Scientist**

*Apr 2022 - Present*
 - Analytics lead on a project to create an interactive optimiser for scheduling maintenance works. This involved helping to build the optimiser in Python. I was responsible for collaborating with other teams building different parts of the tool to ensure smooth integration and owning the quality assurance of the optimiser and ancillary apps.
 - Rapidly deployed an R Shiny app to explore and visualize the results of an optimisation process that allowed the customer to define branching paths of investment priorities stretching into the long term future. This involved creating novel user interface elements that simplify an intricate concept of adaptive future pathways to get quick and clear answers to customer questions.
 - Contributed to an extension of a stock management application that forecasted stock levels and issue rates for warehouses using Facebook's Prophet package in order to automatically set re-order points and safety stock levels saving admin time and warehouse space across the organization. The main responsibilities on the project were to develop the shiny app to be integrated into a larger application, statistically test the output to ensure accuracy and consistency and to demo the product to stakeholders.
 - Worked on multiple R shiny apps whose purpose was to display and manage various sources of multi-dimensional data. These apps included representations of asset data, investment schemes, GIS data and branching future scenario pathways. 
 - A typical technology stack for a project will use Azure (blob storage and container registries), Kubernetes, Github for source control and would be built in R / Shiny or Python. 

### Johnson Matthey - Battery Materials
**Senior Data Scientist**

*Sep 2021 - April 2022*
 - Worked with several teams within the battery materials business section to understand workflows and data needs, presented findings to senior managements and gave recommendations to improve the use of data across the whole of the business section.

## Profile

With 12+ years of data analysis experience I have added a solid understanding of statistical methods and variety of advanced analytical tools over the last few years. 
I have a broad range of experience and I'm looking for a new challenge to combine my passions for sustainability and data analysis / visualisation.
My work has previously been used in scientific research, governmental press releases and formed the basis for significant commercial decisions. 

### Experience

### Arcadis Gen - Data and Decision Science

*Apr 2022 - Present*
 - Analytics lead on a project to create an interactive optimiser for scheduling maintenance works. This involved helping to build the optimiser in python, hosted on azure in a kubernetes cluster, being responsible for collaborating with other teams building different parts of the tool to ensure smooth integration and owning the quality assurance of the optimiser and ancillary apps.
 - Rapidly deployed an app to explore and visualize the results of an optimisation process that allowed the customer to define branching paths of investment priorities stretching into the long term future. This involved creating novel user interface elements that simplify a intricate concept of adaptive future pathways to get quick and clear answers to customer questions.
 - Contributed to an extension of a stock management application that forecasted stock levels and issue rates for warehouses in order to automatically set re-order points and safety stock levels saving admin time and warehouse space across the organization. The main responsibilities on the project were to develop the shiny app to be integrated into a larger application, statistically test the output to ensure accuracy and consistency and to demo the product to stakeholders.

## Profile

An experienced data scientist who is proficient in R, Python, SQL and GitHub. I have used these skills to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to solve problems across environmental, health and technology industries. 
I'm looking for a new challenge to combine my passions for sustainability, data science & GIS.

## Experience

### Arcadis Gen - Data and Decision Science
**Senior Data Scientist**

*Apr 2022 - Present*
 - Lead analyst on a project to use ground movement data gathered from ESA Sentinel 1 satelites (InSAR) to predict failuers in linear assets. This involved geospatially combining multiple datasets, implementing various machine learning techniques to understand what type of ground movements were most predictive of asset failure and then comparing them to choose the most effective methodology.
 - Lead developer on an MILP optimisation live tool for scheduling maintenance works for a national infrastructure company. Built as an Azure function in Python using Google OR-Tools.
 - Lead developer on 2 data manipulation apps alongside the optimisation tool built using R Shiny. They include manipulation of GIS data components using Leaflet visualisation package and the R sf (simple features) package. The apps use data from a PostgreSQL DB.
 - Working as part of a cross functional team I also lead a team of 2 other developers on the project.
 - Prototyped an R Shiny app to explore and visualize the results of an optimisation process that allowed users to define branching paths of investment priorities into the long term future. Creating novel user interface elements that simplify an intricate concept.
 - Maintained and added features to a tool that used Facebook's Prophet package to forecast stock levels from multiple warehouse sites, statistically testing the output and communicating how the tool worked to key stakeholders.
 - Contributed to an internal optimisation package allowing it to use Gurobi's feasibility relaxation feature and enabled users to easily specify penalties to do this.
 - All above pieces of work were source controlled in GitHub.
 - Line manager and coaching responsibility for 3 junior members of staff within the team.

### Johnson Matthey - Battery Materials
**Senior Data Scientist**

*Sep 2021 - Apr 2022*
 - Worked with several teams within the battery materials business section to understand workflows and data needs, presented findings to senior managements and gave recommendations to improve the use of data across the whole of the business section. 
 - Built a prototype of a data exporer app in Python Dash for a lab test machine which used propriatory data formats. 
 - Acted as an internal statistical consultant.

### NEC Software Solutions
**Data Scientist**

*Apr 2020 - Sep 2021*
 - Gathered requirements from academics and clinical experts to design and build a testing regime to evaluate the performance of an AI / computer vision diagnosis tool for diabetic eye screening.
 - Developed and automated monthly reports for medical device manufacturers using a mix of technologies (R, MS SQL Server, Excel, Word)
 - Undertook bespoke analyses and reports completed mainly in R and RMarkdown with occasional production of D3.js and ArcGIS visualisations.
 - Drove improvements in the tools and workflow of the health department's data science team, bringing in new methodologies and commissioning an analysis server.
 - Worked with the internal development team using Agile methodology to deliver web based interactive data analysis in PowerBI.

### University of York
**Data Analyst, Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group**

*Nov 2013 - Apr 2020*

 - Maintained a continually updating complex medical dataset using MySQL and MS SQL Server to be used in health sciences research.
 - Produced statistical analysis used in peer reviewed papers using R and Stata
 - Built interactive data visualisations for a project website using Javascript, D3.js, GIS and HTML/CSS
 - Used Python to create an optical character recognition widget to search through 1000's of scanned paper medical notes finding just the information needed.

### Telefónica UK
**MIS Analyst, Credit and Risk** 

*May 2012 – Nov 2013*

 - Management information and internal reporting using MS SQL Server, Excel, Access, VBA and Business Objects.
 - Involved the management and manipulation of large complex datasets from multiple sources.

### Energy Saving Trust
**Reporting Officer, Energy Assistance Package**

*May 2009 – Apr 2012*
